## Retro:

| Team Member   | Good Practices                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Good: doing tasks more efficiently, don't have to be in call with someone everytime I needed something or had a problem |
| Alex Yang     | We are merging to development branches early, rather than last day                                                      |
| Andy Phylim   | Everyone is respectful of the situations, but communication has still been good                                         |
| Cherie Kong   | Still good communication, even though we had to have downtime we made sure to continuously update each other            |
| Deon Li       | Still good communication, people went to standup, made sure that they still had time to be avaiable                     |
| Frank Chen    | Everyone is still pretty committed despite our other courses, everyone stays update                                     |
| Raymond Chen  | Good workable amount, avoided overcommitting in a sprint where everyone was heavily busy                                |

(Positive) Key Take Aways:
- Communication between teammates continues to be a strong point for our team, we should continue our practice of messaging on Discord
    - Have people ping each other about when to work together in one of the chat rooms
- Everyone should continue to support each other when messages are pinged, and people are respectful of others time
    - This was especially important this sprint, where everyone was pinned by exams

| Team Member   | Bad Practices                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alex Wan      | Sometimes people weren't sure exactly what we wanted and had to modify some tasks afterwards.                 |
| Alex Yang     | We took a bit too long to start working, lacked momentum from last sprint, slow start                         |
| Andy Phylim   | Getting code out was difficult due to scheduling, need to have better communication about requirements        |
| Cherie Kong   | Setting personal deadlines and being more strict about it                                                     |
| Deon Li       | Need to keep each other more accountable for when stuff is to be done                                         |
| Frank Chen    | We should have better communications about requirements from front to back, need to talk about what is needed |
| Raymond Chen  | Momentum was lost going into sprint-3, need to somehow maintain it from sprint to sprint                      |

(Negative) Key Take Aways:
- While communication about time and scheduling was done well, communication about requirements between front and back faultered
    - We should have better acceptance criteria, to ensure that both sides have better ideas about what is needed, rather than go back and forth
- We lacked momentum due to the barrage of exams and A2
    - We need to keep momentum and push once a sprint ends and to keep people more accountable about their deadlines

Best/Worst Experience:
Everyone had the same answer 
- The best experience we had was when we finally got parts to work and when we got it all of it together.
- When we had to do all the merge conflicts and trying to check what was out dated was definitely the worst.    
    - Though this time was way easier...

Things to be completed:
- We completed everything required for Sprint-3.
