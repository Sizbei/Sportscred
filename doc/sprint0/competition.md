How is your product different ?

This application is geared toward sports fans who enjoy to debate topics of such interest. 
It provides additional features that help evaluate a person as an 'analyst' (trivia, picks,
participation). As it does not solely focus on evaluating a person in one area , one who is in 
a position is someone who is all around well knoweledged in all areas. It is constantly testing 
a user so that they can never assume that they know everything and continously refines their skills.
This app encourages a person to always deepen their knowledge so that users are able to have more depth
in discussion as well as have a more analytical approach to sports. 

Why do you think the competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And, what
wouldit take from them to do so?

There has not been a focus as there is a lack of encouragement for users to have more analytical 
discussions. Most often users will have an opinon and generally think that they have a lot of knowledge in 
sports. There will be ways users will engaged in debates through posts on websites that are not geared towards
serious discussions and lack a model to evaluate the value of such discussion. In order to get competitors to 
focus on this group there must be a platform that can provide a ranking or sorts that would encourage users to 
input more serious and logical discussions and can give values through a systematic way. Platforms that provide
such rankings must also hold a certain amount of credability as having a ranking on a website does not mean much
if the system that evaluates is a simple or inadaquete enough to fully value a user's contribution. There must also be 
value for scoring high in the platform. Currently the sports industry is based on interpersonal connections meaning that 
getting a job is not about what you know but who you know. To better encourage refining analytical skills rather than 
networking skills, the platform should be able to aid in obtaining such jobs so that competitors realize the value and 
will gear towards creating applications of such.
